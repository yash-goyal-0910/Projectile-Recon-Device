## 🧭 Overview

The **Projectile Reconnaissance Device (PRD)** is a **use-and-dump IoT sensor capsule** designed to be projected, dropped, or thrown into **hazardous, structurally unstable, or inaccessible locations**—such as collapsed buildings, mines, or deep caves—where human entry is impossible or dangerous.

The device autonomously collects environmental, spatial, and thermal data after deployment and transmits it wirelessly to a **remote Ground Control Station**.  
Its core innovation lies in **computational correction**, which digitally levels the captured LiDAR map even when the device lands at an unpredictable tilt.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Disposable Design:** Low-cost build (~₹10,000) for one-time reconnaissance operations.
- **“Dumb Sensor / Smart Receiver” Architecture:** Lightweight device transmits raw data; the ground station performs heavy computation and visualization.
- **Multi-Sensor Data Fusion:**
  - LiDAR-based 2D/3D mapping
  - Orientation correction using IMU fusion
  - Environmental safety readings (temperature, humidity, pressure, air quality)
  - IR thermal imaging for search & rescue
- **Computational Leveling:** Corrects sensor data for tilt and pitch after landing.
- **Mission Dashboard:** Real-time visualization in a futuristic, dark-themed control interface (React-based).

## 🧠 Core Innovation: Computational Correction

When the capsule lands, it may rest at an **arbitrary tilt angle** on uneven terrain.  
Instead of using costly gyroscopic stabilizers or servo-leveling mechanisms, the PRD uses **orientation data from the BNO055 IMU** to digitally correct all incoming LiDAR data.

### Mathematical Concept:
Let:
- `θx`, `θy`, `θz` = Roll, Pitch, Yaw from IMU  
- `d` = LiDAR distance readings  

The **rotation matrix** derived from IMU orientation is applied to transform each LiDAR point `(x, y, z)` back to a global, level frame, thus generating a **flat, corrected 3D terrain map**.
